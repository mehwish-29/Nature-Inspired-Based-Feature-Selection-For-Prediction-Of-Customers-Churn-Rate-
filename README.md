# Nature-Inspired-Based-Feature-Selection-For-Prediction-Of-Customers-Churn-Rate
The main goal was to enhance the prediction of customers churn rate with the broad focus on use of three distinct algorithms for feature extraction to improve accuracy.
â—¦	Cocco Search Algorithm, Firefly Algorithm and Grey wolf Optimization algorithm were used for feature extraction


This study investigates the efficacy of nature-inspired feature selection techniques in predicting customer churn rates within the telecommunications sector. The key to unlock solutions to this problem is by forecasting the customers which are at risk of churning on how to predict customer behavior and retain existing customers. The objective is to construct a robust churn prediction model using Support Vector Machine (SVM) as the primary classifier, enhanced by three nature-inspired optimization algorithms: Cuckoo Search Algorithm (CS), Firefly Algorithm (FA), and Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO). Each algorithm is individually applied to refine the SVM model's predictive performance, after which the model is trained on the training dataset and evaluated on the testing dataset. 

Each feature extraction model exhibited varying performance levels in predicting customer churn. The CSA-SVM model achieved the highest accuracy of 87.871%, followed by the FA-SVM model with 84.516% accuracy and the GWA-SVM model with 84.345% accuracy. Categorizing churn rates into high, low, or medium further enhances understanding, enabling businesses to prioritize retention efforts effectively.
In conclusion, predicting churn and categorizing churn rates are crucial for telecom businesses to maintain customer loyalty and maximize profitability. 
This study's implications extend beyond telecom, showcasing the practical utility of nature-inspired algorithms in optimizing machine learning models for real-world applications. Future research should focus on refining models, incorporating additional evaluation metrics, and exploring applications in other industries. Overall, this report serves as a comprehensive guide for navigating customer churn challenges and implementing effective retention strategies in the competitive telecom landscape
